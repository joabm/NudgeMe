## Introduction
  - Have you ever set up reminders for things that repeat day after day, like a mantra you want to keep in your mind or 
    a habit you are trying to form, only to find that eventually your scheduled reminders become predictable and lose the
    spark you intended for them to have?  NudgeMe is a perfect solution to keep those reminders alive.  This app delivers
    notifications to you at random times throughout the day and with content that is selected randomly from a list of
    messages that you provide.
  
## Description
  - NudgeMe provides users with notifications without a regular schedule.
  - The user provides minimal input to customize thier experience. 
  - The app then delivers notifications to the user at random times throughtout the day.
  - The content of the notification is a message selected randomly from a list the user provides.
  - Users will be able to select the time of day in which they want to receive the reminders.
  - A history of reminders that have been scheduled is provided where the user can see which reminders they are receiving
    over the course of time.

## How to use the app on iPhone
  - Install the app on your phone and launch the app
  - The app requires permission to deliver notifications to you.
  - The app also asks for permission for your general location.  This app does not require your exact location.
  - From the main view, tap a category for the reminders and add your own reminder messages to each category.   Feel free
    to use the default reminders.
  - Next select the "Set up Reminders" button.  From this view you will be able to select a start and end time
    for when you want to receive the notifications.
  - Next toggle the reminders to select a different set of reminders for the day.
  - Send the notifications.  NudgeMe will schedule the notification at random times within the interval of 
    time you selected.
  - Finally put the app in the background (required for this app) and go about your day. You will receive the reminder
    notifications.  Your reminders will remain fresh as they pop into notifications throughout the day.
